# The Only Tech Blog

## Description

As a coder searching for new technologies in the coding space, I wanted to create a single location where web developers can share their opinions. During this project, I learned the benefits of having normal practice coding structures. It became easy to get lost in all of the files and how they linked to one another. The MVC layout compartmentalized the files so it was easier to navigate.
